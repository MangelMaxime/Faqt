Faqt
====

**Fantastic fluent assertions for your F# tests and domain pre-/post-conditions/invariants.**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmeeren/Faqt/main/logo/faqt-logo-docs.png" width="300" align="right" />

Faqt improves on the best of [FluentAssertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions)
and [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly) and serves it steaming hot on a silver platter to the discerning F#
developer.

**It aims to the best assertion library for F#.**

If you don't agree, I consider that a bug - please raise an issue. ðŸ˜‰

### Work in progress, 1.0 to be released September 2023

Faqt is currently a work in progress. All "infrastructure" and supporting features are in place; some actual assertions
remain to be implemented. A feature complete 1.0 version will hopefully be released by the end of September 2023.

### Versioning and breaking changes

Faqt follows [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/) and aims to preserve **source and binary** compatibility between
releases, except when the major version is incremented. Note that any change to the assertion message format is
considered a non-breaking change.

## A motivating example

Here is an example of what you can do with Faqt. Simply use `Should()` to start asserting, whether in a unit test or for
validating preconditions etc. in domain code (the latter is demonstrated below). For subsequent calls to `Should` in the
same chain, use `Should(())` (double parentheses - this is required for subject names to work properly). Like
FluentAssertions, all assertions support an optional "because" parameter that will be used in the output.

```f#
type Customer =
    | Internal of {| ContactInfo: {| Name: {| LastName: string |} |} option |}
    | External of {| Id: int |}

let calculateFreeShipping customer =
    customer
        .Should()
        .BeOfCase(Internal, "This function should only be called with internal customers")
        .Whose.ContactInfo.Should(())
        .BeSome()
        .Whose.Name.LastName.Should(())
        .Be("Armstrong", "Only customers named Armstrong get free shipping")
```

(The example is formatted using [Fantomas](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/), which line-breaks fluent chains at
method calls. While the readability of Faqt assertion chains could be slightly improved by manual formatting, entirely
foregoing automatic formatting is not worth the slight benefit to readability.)

Depending on the input, a `Faqt.AssertionFailedException` may be raised with one of these messages:

If customer is `External`:

```
Subject: customer
Because: This function should only be called with internal customers
Should: BeOfCase
Expected: Internal
But was:
  External:
    Id: 1
```

If `ContactInfo` is `None`:

```
Subject:
- customer
- ContactInfo
Should: BeSome
But was: null
```

If `LastName` is not `Armstrong`:

```
Subject:
- customer
- ContactInfo
- Name.LastName
Because: Only customers named Armstrong get free shipping
Should: Be
Expected: Armstrong
But was: Aldrin
```

As you can see, the output is YAML-based (because this is both human readable and works well for arbitrary structured
values). The top-level `Subject` key tells you which part of the code fails, and an array of values is used when using
derived state from an assertion, so you can track the transformations on the original subject.

**Yes, this works even in Release mode or when source files are not available!** See the very simple requirements below.

## Installation and requirements

1. Install Faqt [from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Faqt). Faqt supports .NET 5.0 and higher.
2. If you use path mapping (e.g., CI builds with `DeterministicSourcePaths` enabled) or want to execute assertions where
   source files are not available (e.g. in production), enable the following settings on all projects that call
   assertions (either in the `.fsproj` files or in `Directory.Build.props`):

   ```xml
   <DebugType>embedded</DebugType>
   <EmbedAllSources>true</EmbedAllSources>
   ```

   Alternatively, enable them by passing the following parameters to your `dotnet build`/`test`/`publish` commands:

   ```
   -p:DebugType=embedded -p:EmbedAllSources=true
   ```

   Note that `DebugType=embedded` is automatically set
   by [DotNet.ReproducibleBuilds](https://github.com/dotnet/reproducible-builds) if you use that.

## Faqt in a nutshell

As expected by the discerning F# developer, Faqt is:

- **Readable:** Assertions read like natural language and clearly reveal their intention.
- **Concise:** Assertion syntax verbosity is kept to an absolute minimum.
- **Usable:** Faqt comes with batteries included, and contains many useful assertions, including aliases
  (like `BeTrue()` for `Be(true)` on booleans, and `BeSome` for `BeOfCase(Some)` on `option` values).
- **Safe:** Assertions are as type-safe as F# allows.
- **Extensible:** No assertion? No problem! Writing your own assertions is very simple (details below).
- **Informative:** The assertion failure messages are designed to give you all the information you need in a consistent
  and easy-to-read format.
- **Discoverable:** The fluent syntax means you can just type a dot to discover all possible assertions and actions on
  the current value.
- **Composable:** As far as possible, assertions are orthogonal (they check one thing only). For example, an empty
  collection will pass an assertion verifying that the collection only contains items that match a predicate. You can
  chain assertions with `And`, `Whose`, `WhoseValue`, `That`, and `Subject`, assert on derived values like with
  `BeSome()`, and compose assertions with higher-order assertions like `Satisfy` and `SatisfyAll`.
- **Configurable:** You can configure, either globally or for a specific scope, how assertion failure messages are
  rendered. You can easily tweak the defaults or completely replace the formatter.
- **Production-ready:** Faqt is very well tested and is highly unlikely to break your code, whether test or production.
